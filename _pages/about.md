This site is a tool for creating and sharing a booklet of academic material I use in courses or talks.

Iâ€™m slowly writing it, so it is never completed. It is freely available on this website.

If you find a mistake or have any comment, contact me through my GitHub account. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

## Technology

This website is rendered into static HTML with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It uses a custom Jekyll theme called [jekyll-chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook).
